    "copy": "Every day millions of people—from Veterans to immigrants—depend on government services to fulfill their needs. But too often these services are delivered using outmoded policies, practices, and technologies. We're public servants at heart who are driven to make these services work better in a digital world, and that involves implementing a Human-Centered Design (HCD) approach to designing services and products.\n\nOur HCD approach empowers teams to understand, ideate, and design products, services, systems, and experiences that address real users’ core needs. As the foundation of any engagement, HCD acts as a focal lens on the people and processes behind the technology challenges we solve. User experience and direct user research help us understand needs, pain points, and motivations users have as they engage with the services we provide.\n\nWe’ve also instituted lean-Agile practices and engineering throughout our entire company to ensure that everything we offer is designed to enable government success in the digital age through modern practices. Assumptions are risky. We answer critical strategy, design, and tech questions with our rapid, customer-driven, iterative approach to prototyping. Teaming with other cross-functional teams is often a critical and mutually beneficial approach for both the government and for those who partner with the government to bring viable, modern services and solutions to the public.\n\nEach aspect of our approach helps ensure we were delivering the best possible product for a large user base.",
